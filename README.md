## ⚠️ The Challenge
Many government schemes in India have complex eligibility criteria, which makes it difficult for citizens to know which programs they qualify for. This often results in missed opportunities for financial, educational, or health support. Citizens need a reliable, simple, and unbiased tool to understand their eligibility for various schemes.

## 🛠 Our Approach
**Yojana Darpan** solves this problem by combining:

- **✅ Rule-based eligibility checks:** Ensures compliance with official scheme requirements  
- **📊 Probability estimation with ML models:** Estimates the likelihood of approval using Logistic Regression or Random Forest  
- **📝 Explainable reasoning:** Provides human-readable explanations for each eligibility decision  
- **⚖️ Fairness audit:** Monitors sensitive attributes (like gender) to prevent biased predictions  
- **💡 Ethical guidance:** Ensures predictions are advisory and guide users responsibly  

This approach allows users to confidently identify schemes they are eligible for while maintaining fairness and transparency.
